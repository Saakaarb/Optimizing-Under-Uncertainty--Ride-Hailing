# Optimizing-Under-Uncertainty--Ride-Hailing
This is a fun side project that I created after an experience in a strange big city that nearly left me homeless for a night, because I was stuck in an area which was jam-packed with traffic and had no way to reach any Uber that I was booking, even though I was able to walk several blocks if needed, and the Uber had no easy way to get to me without going through traffic. I figured that a feature should exist on ride-hailing apps that optimizes pick-up point selection if asked to (at the time, you had to necessarily select the pick up point) based on current traffic trends. I tried my hand at this problem using a simplified model of streets and traffic, and solved the problem using discrete Upper-Confidence-Bound (UCB) optimization.
